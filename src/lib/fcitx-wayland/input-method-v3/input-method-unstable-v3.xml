  <description summary="Protocol for creating input methods">
    This protocol allows applications to act as input methods for compositors.

    An input method context is used to manage the state of the input method.

    Text strings are UTF-8 encoded, their indices and lengths are in unicode characters.

    This document adheres to the RFC 2119 when using words like "must",
    "should", "may", etc.

    Warning! The protocol described in this file is experimental and
    backward incompatible changes may be made. Backward compatible changes
    may be added together with the corresponding interface version bump.
    Backward incompatible changes are done by bumping the version number in
    the protocol and interface names and resetting the interface version.
    Once the protocol is to be declared stable, the 'z' prefix and the
    version number in the protocol and interface names are removed and the
    interface version number is reset.

        text like it is done for CJK languages.

        The compositor should send all keyboard events on the seat to the grab

        the time of its creation.

        The compositor must issue this request when the object is no longer
        useable, e.g. due to seat removal.

        The input method context becomes inert and should be destroyed after
        deactivation is handled. Any further requests and events except for the
        destroy request must be ignored.

    <event name="surrounding_text">
      <description summary="surrounding text event">
        Updates the surrounding plain text around the cursor, excluding the
        preedit text.

        If any preedit text is present, it is replaced with the cursor for the
        purpose of this event.

        The argument text is a buffer containing the preedit string, and must
        include the cursor position, and the complete selection. It should
        contain additional characters before and after these. There is a
        maximum length of wayland messages, so text can not be longer than 4000
        bytes.

        cursor is the byte offset of the cursor within the text buffer.

        anchor is the byte offset of the selection anchor within the text
        buffer. If there is no selected text, anchor must be the same as
        cursor.

        If this event does not arrive before the first done event, the input
        method may assume that the text input does not support this
        functionality and ignore following surrounding_text events.

        Values set with this event are double-buffered. They will get applied
        and set to initial values on the next zwp_input_method_v3.done
        event.

        The initial state for affected fields is empty, meaning that the text
        input does not support sending surrounding text. If the empty values
        get applied, subsequent attempts to change them may have no effect.

        Whenever the client detects an external change in text, cursor, or
        anchor position, it must issue this request to the compositor. This
        request is intended to give the input method a chance to update the
        preedit text in an appropriate way, e.g. by removing it when the user
        starts typing with a keyboard.

        cause describes the source of the change.

        The value set with this event is double-buffered. It will get applied

        The serial number reflects the last state of the zwp_input_context_v3

        the compositor receives a commit request with a serial different than
        the number of past done events, it must proceed as normal, except it
        should not change the current state of the zwp_input_context_v3 object.
